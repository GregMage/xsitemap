  XML standard for the sitemap. When you create the XML file in the
  installation phase of the module, it is not complete since Xsitemap is not
  yet able to read the plugin installed. We must then rebuild the XML file
  with the appropriate button from the control panel or by visiting the page
  xsitemap/xml_google.php.
